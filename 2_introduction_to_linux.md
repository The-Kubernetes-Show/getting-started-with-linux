### Weekly Video Release Plan
To ensure a structured and engaging learning experience, I have designed a rotating schedule for video releases:
- **Week 1**: Beginner-friendly content to help you build a strong foundation.
- **Week 2**: Advanced topics, such as Kubernetes, Linux internals, or other in-depth subjects.
- **Week 3**: More beginner-focused content to reinforce the core concepts.
- **Week 4**: Advanced topics to challenge and expand your expertise.

This balanced approach caters to learners at all levels, ensuring steady progress and a comprehensive understanding of Linux and related technologies.

**Finally**, beginner-level content will eventually become a set of playlists containing specific subtopics, e.g., Linux permissions, Linux filesystem to all the way to Kubernetes Control Plane components, etcd, Helm, Clouds etc.
